## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. YouTube
  * Loading bar for video lengths
  * Red dot for notifications, but not overwhelming
2. Instagram
  * Loading bar for video lengths
  * Smooth scrolling between reels
3. Discord
  * Bubble icons for servers
  * Channels can be grouped
4. Reddit
  * Arrows for like/dislike and point system
  * Photos embedded in posts

App Idea: I think creating a flashcard app is beneficial in terms of learning iOS development and for personal use. Similar to Quizlet,
users can create flippable flashcards containing questions/terms and answers/definitions. Hopefully, users can group cards based on
topics or subjects. Other features can be added, like level of difficulty, reoccurrence of a card, and photos for each card.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
